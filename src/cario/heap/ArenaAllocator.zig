    //   slower.

    //   will make reset slower, but alloc() keeps the same speed when reset() as if reset()
    //   would not exist.

    // The second variant was chosen for implementation, as with more and more calls to reset(),
    // the function will get faster and faster. At one point, the complexity of the function
    // will drop to amortized O(1), as we're only ever having a single chunk that will not be
    // reallocated, and we're not even touching the backing allocator anymore.
